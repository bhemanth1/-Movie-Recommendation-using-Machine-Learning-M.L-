# Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning  

WE HAVE DONE THE TWO PROJECTS

### 1. Movie Recommendation System (Hollywood Dataset)  
We have developed a recommendation system using the Hollywood Movie Dataset. The system suggests movies based on user preferences and leverages machine learning techniques for accurate predictions.

### 2. An Incremental Approach for the Selection of Bias in Recommendation System (Tollywood Dataset)  
This project focuses on building a recommendation system for the Tollywood Movie Dataset using **Collaborative Filtering** and the **PIP (Proximity, Impact, Popularity) measure**.  

#### Features:  
- **Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering Systems**: Implemented to provide personalized recommendations.  
- **PIP Measure**: Enhances the recommendation accuracy by considering proximity, impact, and popularity.  
- **Process Workflow**:  
  - Data Collection using Web Scraping
  - Data Preparation and Cleaning  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Data Visualizations  
  - Machine Learning Model Application
